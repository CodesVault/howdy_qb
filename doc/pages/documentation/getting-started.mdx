# Getting Started

## Installation
Install the library using composer `composer require codesvault/howdy_qb`.

## Database connection
It connects to the WordPress database **automatically**.
<br />But if you need then you also can set connection manually.

```php
$db = new DB();
$db->setDBConfig([
    "dbhost"        => <mysql host>,
    "dbname"        => <database name>,
    "dbuser"        => <database username>,
    "dbpassword"    => <database password>,
    "prefix"        => <database table prefix>
]);
```
