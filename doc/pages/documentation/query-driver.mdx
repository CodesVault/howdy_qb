# Driver

The default driver is `PDO`.
But if you want to use `wpdb` object, which uses Mysqli. You can do that by changing the driver.
``` php
$db = new DB();
$db::setDriver('wpdb');

// then use the class instense for making queries.	
$db::select('posts.post_title')
    ->from('posts posts')
    ->get();
```
